To change the API methods so that not a full REST API, can write
resources :jobs => only [index, show]
or use "except" or something
g is short for generate in rails
Job.find(id) for getting by id number
Job.find_or_create_by(title: blah)
Job.first and Job.last
p for print

Snowcones: <% are for putting Ruby code inside view template
<%= are template variable language, i.e. "print this thing"Does it matter that we put redirect_to before the update method in the job controller?
